                   <p className="text-left">The ultimate reference in luxury chronograph watches, TAG Heuerâ€™s high-precision timing innovations have kept pace with the evolution of sports since 1860. Our timepieces make it possible to capture every fraction of a second of a performance. From the wrists of the drivers who have marked the history of motor racing to your wrist, TAG Heuer watches have a lasting impact on their time and their era. Shortly after its inception, TAG Heuer introduced the Mikrograph - a mechanical chronograph five times more accurate than any other - and became the official timekeeper for the most famous sports competitions. With the arrival of motorsports, TAG Heuer became the first watchmaking brand to sponsor the Formula 1 World Championship since its creation.</p>
